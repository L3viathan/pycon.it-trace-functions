# Trace functions — Building a tiny debugger

This is a talk I held at PyCon IT 2023: https://pycon.it/en/submission/xwme (video coming soon)

The slides are in `slides.md`. You can just look at them in a normal Markdown viewer or text editor. The weird lines starting with an exclamation mark are special syntax for [representty](http://pypi.org/project/representty), which you can also use to show the slides.

The resulting code is in `mypdb.py` (and the accompanying, buggy code in — you guessed it — `buggy_code.py`).

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to open a discussion post on Github, or contact me directly.
